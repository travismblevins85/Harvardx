"""When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter 
was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs 
that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase."""


s = input("Input: ")
print("Output: ", end="")

for c in s:
    if not c.lower() in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:
        print(c, end="")
