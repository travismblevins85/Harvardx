"""In plates.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a vanity plate and then output Valid if meets all of the requirements 
or Invalid if it does not. Assume that any letters in the usr’s input will be uppercase. Structure your program per the below, 
wherein is_valid returns True if s meets all requirements and False if it does not. Assume that s will be a str. You’re welcome to 
implement additional functions for is_valid to call (e.g., one function per requirement)."""
